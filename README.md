# Musea: global artwork explorer platform üñºÔ∏è

Musea is a modern and interactive web application that aims to change the way people interact with museum databases. With Musea, anyone can explore a vast collection of artworks, learn about artists, and visit the world's most famous collections digitally. [See the project online here.](https://juliaisasti.github.io/Musea/pages/home.html) 

Project's main focus, copied from its About page:
One place to sum every museum API.

Museums are said to be the way to democratize art. Through that logic, anyone should be able to access museums and their art. But we know that to not be true.

We hold a different hope for digital platforms: the digitalization of art and museum archives can lead to further advance the accessibility to them for anyone anywhere in the world. Well done art data bases can change how we learn art history worldwide - Musea's intention is to center them in one place: learn about artists and their work, save the artworks that interest you and explore through our map museums and art centers around you.

This project was created for The Bridge's Fullstack Web Development course, by [Julia Isasti](https://github.com/juliaisasti).
